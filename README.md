I spent my free time on weekends and nights to writing code. I've release many open-source projects and contributed to many others. 

I'm falling in love with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org), if you are using Nim, you may using my work (even you didnt notice that) 🙃

If my work has been useful or saved you time, consider buy me some beer 🍺
